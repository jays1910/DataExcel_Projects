Project Name:-IMDB Movie Analysis 

Software used:- Excel

Project Description:- Analyzed IMDB movie data by performing data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values and removing duplicates, 
to prepare the dataset for analysis. I explored relationships between key variables such as movie ratings, genres, directors,
and budget, identifying patterns and correlations. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the most common genres, 
Additionally, I identified the most common languages used in films and analyzed their impact on IMDB scores.
Top directors were ranked based on their average IMDB scores, using percentile calculations to assess their contributions
to successful movies. Finally, I analyzed the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings, identifying the films
with the highest profit margins.
